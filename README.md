# RemoteWindow

A window sharer app shares window over network.

### `Warning:` This is just a experiment, but it works.

## Whats missing?

- Compression of packages is required its (512 * 4) per package. Higher package size will increase fps but pacakge losses will occur more.

- Screen recorder library maybe not the greatest choice, it will error out sometimes even waiting for 80ms
